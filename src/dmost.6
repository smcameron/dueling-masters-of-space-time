.PP
Dueling masters of space time is a two player turn based strategy game
that has been described as a cross between chess, battleship, and 
stratego.
.PP
Each player has his own representation of the board, which consists of
a 10x10 grid of squares.  Initially, half the board is assigned to one
player and half to the other.  Each player secretly deploys his pieces
on his half of the board.  The pieces consist of, from strongest to
weakest: 1 W-fighter, 1 B-fighter, 2 X-fighters, 2 Y-fighters, 4 Z-fighters,
and 7 immobile asteroids, and 1 home planet.  The W fighter moves like a
chess knight.  The B fighter moves like a chess queen, the X fighters move
like chess rooks, the Y fighters move like chess bishops, and the Z fighters
move like chess queens.  The home planet and asteroids are immobile.
.PP
Each square of the grid has a name, formed by combining the row -- A-J and
the column -- 1-10.  When a player makes a move, he informs his opponent
of the departure location and identity of the piece being moved, but not
of the destination.  Conflict resolution occurs when a pieces is moved.
Your opponent, who is tracking the prior locations of all your pieces will
inform you if your piece actually made it to the location you are attempting
to depart by comparing the prior trajectory with the pieces on his board.
.PP It is thus possible to intercept a piece after it has already been
moved (or, while it is in transit, if you prefer to think of it that way)
or likewise, dodge out of the way after a piece has been moved.  In a 
collision, the strongest pieces destroys all other weaker enemy pieces.
.PP
The object of the game is to destroy your opponent's home planet by 
raming into it with one of your pieces.
